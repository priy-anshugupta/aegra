"""Declarative map of every Agent Protocol route to its ``@auth.on`` identity.

Authorization used to be wired by hand inside each route body, which made
"forgot to call ``handle_event``" invisible: the route worked, the tests passed,
and a user's ``@auth.on.assistants`` handler simply never ran. Whole routers
shipped with no dispatch at all.

The map below is the single source of truth for which ``(resource, action)``
pair a route authorizes as. ``tests/unit/test_core/test_auth_registry.py``
asserts every mounted route is either listed here or explicitly exempt, so a new
route cannot silently join the unprotected set.

Path keys are FastAPI templates (``/threads/{thread_id}``), matched exactly.
